h1. Important notice!

This extension will probably be discontinued from this point on. "Bastian Allgeier":http://www.bastian-allgeier.de/ and I have consolidated our separate addons into "the official Zootool extension":http://zootool.com/tools/browser.

h1. Zootool for Safari

A toolbar icon to use the Zootool Lasso

h2. Download

You can download Zootool for Safari *"here":http://epogue.s3.amazonaws.com/Zootool.safariextz*

h2. Credit

Pretty much all the credit goes to the Zootool team for their Lasso tool. I just rigged it to work in Safari.

h2. To-do

* Add a way to just automatically save the page without ever hitting the Lasso tool
